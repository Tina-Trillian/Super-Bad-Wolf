# SUPER BAD WOLF

### Revenge the Big Bad Wolf, collect sheep and escape the evil hunter.

A classic Jump-and-Run-Game with a twist.

Playing the Big Bad Wolf you need to collect sheep and avoid the bullets the evil hunters are shooting at you. But beware! Don't touch the water, it brings bad memories of wells and stones in the belly.

Once you reach the second level, maneuver over the platforms, don't look down and be careful of the whales - they are in cahoots with the hunter and the awful granny!
